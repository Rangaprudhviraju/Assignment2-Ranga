###### Albert Hall Museum

 Situated in the Ram Niwas Garden of Jaipur, the Albert Hall Museum is the oldest museum in **Rajasthan**. Built in 1876, it was initially envisioned to be a concert hall and resembles the architecture of the Victoria and Albert Hall Museum in London, hence, the name. It is a standing example of the Indo-Saracenic architecture and is **also known as Government Central Museum**.
